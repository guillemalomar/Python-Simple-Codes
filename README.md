* Test 1
Analyzing the Triangle Problem
It reads three input data values. These values represent the three lengths of the sides of a triangle.
The purpose of this program is to display a message which states whether the triangle is
scalene (i.e., no two sides are equal), isosceles (two sides equal) or equilateral (all sides equal).

* Test 2
The FizzBuzz paradigm
A program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

* Test 3
Object oriented programming problem
A software program used to represent three different shapes: triangles, squares and rectangles. Each shape must implement a draw method for printing the name of the shape and a second method to return the area of the shape.
